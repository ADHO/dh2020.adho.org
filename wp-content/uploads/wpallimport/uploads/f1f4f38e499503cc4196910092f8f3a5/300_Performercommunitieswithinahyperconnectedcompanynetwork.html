The project uses the case study of Dunham�s company, in which almost 200 dancers, drummers, and singers performed across the world for thirty years. The challenge this case poses is how to discover sub-communities among a hyperconnected community of artists who all worked together over time. Based on the concept of the check-in, which explicitly states the presence of performers on a specific date and location, we created a flow diagram and a community network that visualize the performers� individual paths through this hyperconnected network as well as the temporal sub-communities that these form. We analyzed the hyperconnectivity phenomenon from these two perspectives, in an effort to understand the complexity of this highly interconnected network.</p></div><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><address>Antonio Jimenez-Mavillard (antonio.jimenez-mavillard@cssd.ac.uk), Royal Central School of Speech and Drama - University of London, UK, Kate Elswit , Royal Central School of Speech and Drama - University of London, UK and Harmony Bench , Ohio State University, USA</address></div></body></html>
