Currentely we present a stylometric analysis of literature investigating the stylistic markers that differentiate former bestsellers from fiction that remains popular across several decades using a TfIdf vectorization of texts and UMAP dimenision reduction approach. We find that especially a greater variation in sentence length is associated with the chances of a novel to remain popular.</p></div><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><address>Joris J.
