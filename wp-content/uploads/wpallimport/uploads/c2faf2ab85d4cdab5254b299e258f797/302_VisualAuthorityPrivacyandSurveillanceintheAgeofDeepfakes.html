I illustrate that deepfakes make novel use of photographic documents as tools for the violation of individual privacy and in doing so offer a fundamentally different challenge to concepts of visual authority. Digital surveillance and �big data� systems monitor and record the <em>observed</em> actions and behaviours of people. Algorithmic methods extend surveillance to predictions of behaviours that people <em>may possibly, in the future </em>engage in. I situate deepfakes as a further violation of privacy applied to actions and behaviours that<em> have not and never will occur. </em>By establishing deep-learning based forgeries as an extension of existing tools of digital surveillance, I aim to provide a framework for the critical analysis of a new digital technology that is well positioned to become ubiquitous in the very near future.</p></div><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><address>Taylor Arnold (tarnold2@richmond.edu), University of Richmond, United States of America</address></div></body></html>
