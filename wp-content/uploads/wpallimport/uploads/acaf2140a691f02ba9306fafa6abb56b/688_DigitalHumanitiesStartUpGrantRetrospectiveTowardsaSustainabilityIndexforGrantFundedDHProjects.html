As the recent NEH sponsored �Sustaining DH� series illustrates, strategies for sustainable development, dissemination, and preservation are critical if the �making� side of digital humanities are to persist. This paper details an ongoing attempt to develop a �sustainability index� for grant funded digital humanities projects. For the purposes of this paper, we define sustainability as the quality of being accessible/operable following a granting period. We focus on operability as our sustainability index is based on a qualitative analysis of projects that received NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant funding from 2010-2017, specifically under the product type of �Web Resources� or �Computer Programs.� Based on our analysis, we aim to show which criteria increase the likelihood of a sustainable project as well as the criteria that inhibit a project from remaining sustainable.</p></div><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><address>Cal Murgu (cmurgu@ncf.edu), New College of Florida, United States of America and Atalay Kutlay , New College of Florida, United States of America</address></div></body></html>
