In addition, I mainly analyze the twenty-one imperially commissioned poetry anthologies for the literature of the Lotus Sutra, and for paintings, I focus on the frontispieces of the Lotus Sutras written in gold and silver inks on indigo-dyed papers.</p><p>In particular, I attempt to reinterpret the visualization of dimension reduction by using a new method such as t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding?in addition to conventional PCA (principal component analysis) to emphasize the differences instead of similarities.</p><p>This may further reveal the literary peculiarities of the rhetoric, the nature of the �narrative�, or the visual arts-specific rhetoric such as �decoration� and newer contexts.</p></div><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><address>Aiko Aida (nispanna@yahoo.co.jp), Japan society for the Promotion of Science</address></div></body></html>
