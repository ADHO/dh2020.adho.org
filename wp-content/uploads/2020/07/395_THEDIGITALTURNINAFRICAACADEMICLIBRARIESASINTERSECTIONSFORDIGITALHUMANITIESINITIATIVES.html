The role of human scientists is to investigate and answer existing and emerging research questions in the humanities.</p><p>The existing data sources for the human scientists at Makerere University are increasing rapidly. The wealth of data flowing from these are a mixture of structured and unstructured data, that come in a variety of formats, some of which can contain noise and can be partially incomplete.<strong></strong></p><p>Dealing with this growth and complexity of data, necessitates the use of various digital techniques by human scientists, however, would require guidance and facilities â€“ an area where academic libraries can play a crucial role.</p><p>Academic libraries have become <strong>carrefours /intersections </strong>for digital humanities as partners in the research process. This poster will present how Makerere Library is at the center of supporting Digital Humanities Initiatives through the provision of various services.</p></div><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><address>Joseph Ssebulime (josephssebulime1@gmail.com), Makerere University, Uganda and Johann Van Wyk , University of Pretoria, South Africa</address><div class="pt-4 text-center">
