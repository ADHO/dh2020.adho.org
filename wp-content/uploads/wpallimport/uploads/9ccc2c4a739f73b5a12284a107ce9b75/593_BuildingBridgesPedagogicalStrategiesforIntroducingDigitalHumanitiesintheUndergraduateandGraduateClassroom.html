These include identifying and developing the core skill sets students need to begin work in digital humanities, such as best practices for project management, working with data and interpreting and presenting analyses. From a faculty standpoint, the poster will suggest strategies for building collaborative partnerships between libraries and faculty to best leverage each respective groupï¿½s expertise.</p></div><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><address>Sarah Ketchley (ketchley@uw.edu), University of Washington, United States of America and Wendy Perla Kurtz (wpkurtz@ucla.edu), UCLA, United States of America</address></div></body></html>
