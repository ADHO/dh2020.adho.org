In past work, we have shown that it is possible to detect phonetic differences between classes of Shakespeare characters (e.g., protagonists, antagonists) computationally, using Naive Bayes classifiers. In this talk, we will discuss our early attempt to use such classifiers to draw contrast between different <em>playwrights</em>. We lay out a corpus of early modern playwrights on an axis measuring the predictive accuracy of our model. Additionally, we present visual tools for identifying which phonemes are most distinctive for different characters and authors.</p></div><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><address>Oliver Calder (caldero@carleton.edu), Carleton College, United States of America and Eric Carlson Alexander , Carleton College, United States of America</address></div></body></html>
