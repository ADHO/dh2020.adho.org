In the first study, the overall development of Neo-Confucianism is divided into four phases through network analysis. But the numbers of contemporary research papers distributed over these four phases are significant unequal, thus indicating that the second phase, i.e. the period dominated by ancient scholars Yang Shi and Hu Anguo and their disciples, is neglected by contemporary scholars. These blind areas could lead to further humanities research questions.</p></div><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><address>Jun Wang (junwang@pku.edu.cn), Peking University, Beijing, People's Republic of China, Liyuan Zhang (zhangliyuan2013@pku.edu.cn), Peking University, Beijing, People's Republic of China and Haici Yang , Indiana University, Bloomington, United States of America</address><div class="pt-4 text-center">
