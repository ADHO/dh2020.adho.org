It will include bibliographic entries for each event, and will provide links to other archival materials and digital resources on the topic that are available on the internet. We are proposing a poster created by MSU faculty and student team members at DH2020 introducing second phase “stories” on the political movements and protests that enjoyed Kremlin support as a way to disadvantage other national minorities during the period 1989-1991 in several republics and autonomous regions of the USSR.</p>
