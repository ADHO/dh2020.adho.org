This study draws on Spiro�s (2011) methodology, which examines assignments, readings, media types, key concepts, and technologies, in an attempt to characterize the �hidden curriculum� found throughout DH courses. In addition, we attend to issues of global similarities and local differences among the iSchool courses, as well as DH more broadly. In presenting this poster at the conference, we hope to raise awareness of unique aspects of DH education within iSchools and invite discussions with others about education and training in the field, potential partnerships, and pedagogical approaches.</p></div><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><address>Chris Alen Sula (csula@pratt.edu), Pratt Institute, United States of America, Xiaoguang Wang , Wuhan University, China, Heejin Park , Hansung University, Seoul, South Korea and Claudia Berger , Pratt Institute, United States of America</address></div></body></html>
