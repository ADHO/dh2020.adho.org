In recent years efforts have been undertaken to 3DScan Mara<br>et al. (2010), to paleographically describe Homburg (2019) and to digitally recon-<br>struct broken fragments Collins et al. (2014, 2017) of cuneiform tablets. However,<br>not always broken fragments can complement each other and often parts of the<br>cuneiform tablet remain destroyed. These fractures or gaps in the cuneiform<br>tablet are not always easy for scholars to fill and take a considerable amount of<br>interpretation time on their part. With the emergence of more digitally available<br>cuneiform text resources, this publication sees an opportunity to investigate if<br>auto-complete algorithms, based on machine learning and linguistic linked open<br>data (LLOD) resources Homburg (2017) can be useful in the reconstruction<br>of cuneiform texts. The classification results are to be used to create a epoch<br>and language specific recommendation system to fill gaps on cuneiform tablets,<br>therefore assisting cuneiform scholars.</p><p>Related Work</p><p>Related work has been done in autocompletion systems which face the similar<br>challenge of anticipating the users input derived from context and other features<br>Leung & Zhang (2008), Gikandi (2006), Hyv�nen & M�kel� (2006). Those tech-<br>nologies are heavily relied on in input method engines1 which are powered with<br>different dictionary-based algorithms, but recently Chen et al. (2015), Huang<br>et al. (2018) also with machine learning approaches and neural networks. Input<br>method engines for cuneiform have been developed by Homburg et al. (2015).</p><p>Methodology</p><p>Following Homburg & Chiarcos (2016) machine learning methods applied are<br>either based on grammatical rules (POSTagging), dictionary-based methods ex-<br>ploiting (third-party) dictionary resources or statistical approaches using the<br>following types of machine learning features:<br>� Context-dependent features: e.g. for Hidden Markov Model Classifications<br>� Grammatical features derived from POSTaggers<br>� Semantic Features derived from the semantic meaning of surrounding words<br>� Metadata Features e.g. text categorizations<br>� Paleographic Features using PaleoCodage for a subset of manually annotated<br>texts Homburg (2019)</p><p>Experimental Setup</p><p>The effectiveness of the algorithms and features is tested on a corpus of all CDLI<br>texts in ATF which is split in a training and test set. Texts are prepared with<br>random gaps for classification and evaluated using the original texts (the gold<br>standard) on unicode cuneiform and on the respective cuneiform transliteration<br>for different cuneiform languages (Sumerian, Hittite, Akkadian) and epochs. The<br>poster features selected peliminary results of the classification and a significance<br>analysis of the features for further discussion for improvement. A possible future<br>goal could be a shared task to improve classification accuracy similar to the<br>cuneiform language identification challenge Jauhiainen et al. (2019)</p><p>Application</p><p>Lastly, the poster presents a prototypical application (fig. 1)<br>displaying the results of the machine learning process which is currently in devel-<br>opment. The implementation builds up on the concept of input method engines<br>Homburg et al. (2015) and will provide a self-learning component.</p><p>Caption Figure 1: (prototype.jpg)</p><p>Text Completion Prototype: �If...Enlil�.
