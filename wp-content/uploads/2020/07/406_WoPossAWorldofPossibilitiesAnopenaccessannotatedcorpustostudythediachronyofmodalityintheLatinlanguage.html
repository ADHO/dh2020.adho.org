<p>Until now the study of lexical modality – i.e. the expression of the notion of ‘necessity’ and ‘possibility’<sup>1</sup>  – in the Latin language has focused almost exclusively on the synchronic level and mainly on verbs<sup>2</sup>. The investigated corpus has also been limited to a small group of classical authors. Later sources or documentary sources, such as inscriptions, have been neglected. Moreover, no fine-grained annotation of modal types and subtypes has yet been attempted. The SNSF-funded project WoPoss - <em>A</em> Wo<em>rld of </em>Poss<em>ibilities. Modal pathways over an extra-long period of time: the diachrony of modality in the Latin language</em> (agreement n° 176778) aims to fill these gaps and to make available to the scientific community an open access annotated corpus which will be useful for research on modality or modality-related issues. As annotation progresses, data will be made available during the project lifespan (February 2019–January 2023)<sup>3</sup>.
In this paper I want to briefly present the main innovative features of the WoPoss corpus (A1-3) and of the WoPoss annotation (B1-5, see Dell’Oro 2019, Dell’Oro - Bermúdez Sabel – Marongiu 2020) :

</p>
<p>A1)	WoPoss adopts a diachronic approach: the corpus spans from the 3rd century BCE to the 7th century CE;</p>
<p>A2)	the list of markers to be annotated is not limited to modal verbs (e.g. <em>debeo</em>), but includes nouns (e.g. <em>necessitas</em>), adjectives (e.g. <em>necessarius</em>), adverbs (e.g. <em>necessarie</em>), modal phrases (e.g. <em>necesse est/habeo</em>) and adjectival suffixes (such as -<em>bilis</em>, -<em>ndus</em>, -<em>turus</em>);</p>
<p>A3)	the WoPoss corpus aims to be representative of any type of (socio-)linguistic variation:
	</p>
<p>- as it emerges from different kinds of transmission support (codex, papyrus, inscription);</p>
	<p>- at the geographical level;</p>
	<p>- in terms of textual and literary genres.</p>

<p>B1)	 the WoPoss annotation is mixed, partially automatic (e.g., for morpho-syntax and some metadata), partially manual (fine-grained semantic annotation)</p>
<p>B2)	 in contrast to the few projects annotating at least one type of modality, the main goal of the WoPoss annotation is not to label different types of modality, but <b>to annotate in parallel a series of parameters which will allow any user of the corpus to understand both why the annotators recognised a certain (sub-)type of modality and what the correlations are between these parameters and a certain (sub-)type of modality</b>;</p>
<p>B3)	 the WoPoss annotation allows to annotate more than one modal reading, if ambiguity is inherent in the use of a modal marker (polysemy) in the context;</p>
<p>B4)	 it takes into consideration also pragmatic and rhetoric uses of modal markers, by distinguishing literal levels of analysis and contextual ones;</p>
<p>B5)	 gradable concepts are evaluated on wide-range scales (e.g. epistemic modality is evaluated on a five-degree scale).</p>
<p>The WoPoss fine-grained semantic analysis will enable the reconstruction of modal pathways as well as to study co-occurrence and competition mechanisms among modal forms in the history of the Latin language. It will also enhance dialogue among researchers using other frameworks or working on other languages.</p>
	
<p> <sup>1</sup>There is no consensual definition of modality. The theoretical frame of the project was largely inspired by Nuyts’ attempt to formulate a broad, ideally consensual definition of the modal domain (Nuyts 2016).</p>
<p> <sup>2</sup>Cf. the monographs by Bolkestein 1980 and Núñez 1991. There are of course welcome exceptions among shorter publications, e.g. Fruyt - Moussy 2002.</p>
