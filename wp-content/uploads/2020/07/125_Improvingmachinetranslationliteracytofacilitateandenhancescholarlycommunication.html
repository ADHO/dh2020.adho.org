Contemporary machine translation approaches such as neural machine translation (NMT) are data-driven and use artificial-intelligence-based machine learning techniques; however, such tools rarely produce high quality output of specialized text without human intervention. There is an emerging need for machine translation (MT) literacy among non-Anglpohone students and faculty who must both read and write in English in order to participate fully in the scholarly communication process. We designed and pilot tested a machine translation literacy workshop to help researchers use MT more effectively for scholarly tasks such as: 1) search and discovery of scholarly texts; 2) reading and evaluating scholarly texts; 3) research communication in international teams; and 4) writing for scholarly publishing. Pre- and post-workshop surveys were used to evaluate the success of the workshop and recommend improvements for future iterations.</p></div><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><address>Lynne Bowker (lbowker@uottawa.ca), University of Ottawa, Canada</address><div class="pt-4 text-center">
