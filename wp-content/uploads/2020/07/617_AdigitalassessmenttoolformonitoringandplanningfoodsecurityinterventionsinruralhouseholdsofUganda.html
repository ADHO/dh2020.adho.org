It provides instant results in the form of statistics that can help in planning for appropriate interventions. Food security is an essential and universal measurement of community well-being. The fact that food security is a complex and multidimensional concept, its measurement has been a challenge to both researchers and practitioners. The tool makes food security assessment and monitoring easier and can generate instant statistics that can inform appropriate interventions aimed at enhancing decisions of rural communities on food security. The digital tool was evaluated with the intended users and evaluation results indicate that it is a useful device for monitoring food security and informing intervention programs.</p></div><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><address>Robert Tweheyo (rtweheyo@gmail.com), Kyambogo University, Uganda</address><div class="pt-4 text-center">
