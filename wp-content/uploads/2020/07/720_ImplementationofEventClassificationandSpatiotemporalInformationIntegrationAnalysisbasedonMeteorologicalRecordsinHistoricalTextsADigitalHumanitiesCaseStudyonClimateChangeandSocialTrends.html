<p>Seeing the vision of things is the great application concept of Science Research. Since extreme climate event occurs more often than before, the importance of the research about the historical climate texts increases as well. Tracing back to the contemporary occurrence and the impact of climate disasters, we could find the cues in a rich database from early Chinese historical texts. By extracting the natural phenomena in the historical texts, analyzing the environmental possibilities and restrictions, learning on the impact on social phenomena at the time, we gain insight into the causes and effects of social pulsations. This study takes the ’China's Three Thousand Years of Meteorological Record’ (2013) which collects more than 7,000 historical records of as the text source, categorizing from regions, dates, presenting the visualize data on the graphic platform and analyze the spatial and temporal characteristics of social humanity events caused by nature phenomena.</p>
