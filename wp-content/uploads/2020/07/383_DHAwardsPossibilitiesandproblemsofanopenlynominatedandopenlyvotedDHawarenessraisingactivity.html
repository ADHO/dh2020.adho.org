<p dir="ltr">This long paper explores the annual <em>Digital Humanities Awards</em>, run as an openly-nominated and openly-voted DH awareness-raising activity at http://dhawards.org/, through a history of their development and consideration of a number of problematic aspects concerning them in assessing their future. Although often praised, there has been a variety of criticism of them. Presented by the founder and main instigator of <em>DH Awards</em>, this paper opens up discussion on these issues, while benefiting from a privileged position of having access to all of the confidential raw nomination and voting data for the entire run of <em>DH Awards</em> (2012 to present). Additional feedback will also be collected during the <em>DH Awards 2019</em> round of voting (in early 2020). This paper does not seek to dismiss criticisms, but to engage with them to discuss whether the <em>DH Awards</em> are a positive force and the best ways to ameliorate any issues raised.</p>
