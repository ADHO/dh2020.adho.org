101,"Hoover, David Lowell","New York University - Main Campus, United States of America","Booth Tarkington, Blindness, Dictation, and the Durability of Style","Booth Tarkington, Blindness, Dictation, and the Durability of Style","style, dictation, literary composition","English, North America, 19th Century, 20th Century, attribution studies and stylometric analysis, Literary studies","<p>When Booth Tarkington suffered from severe vision problems and temporary complete blindness in 1929, he began to dictate almost all of his literary works, a practice he continued even after regaining good eyesight in 1931. This submission investigates the possible effects of this change in mode of composition on Tarkington's style. The tentative conclusion is that there is almost no evidence of any effect, which suggests that authorial style can be quite durable in the face of a complete change in the way the author produces his text.</p>

103,"Anderson, Talea","Washington State University, United States of America","Effect of Promotion, Rank, and Tenure Guidelines on Open Data Distribution","Effect of Promotion, Rank, and Tenure Guidelines on Open Data Distribution",open data,"English, North America, Contemporary, data publishing projects, systems, and methods, data, object, and artefact preservation, Library & information science","<p>Promotion, rank, and tenure (PRT) guidelines have been cited as a key motivation for why and how faculty choose to publish their research. Open-access (OA) advocates have noted in particular that lukewarm or negative portrayals of OA venues in PRT guidelines can result in decreased participation in OA publishing. In response to this concern, some universities have begun to experiment with adding language to PRT guidelines that invites broader participation in publishing venues, including OA publishing. Of interest in this study is the impact of PRT guidelines on the distribution of open data. Specifically, this poster will rely on information gathered from SHARE to consider the prevalence of participation in open data publishing at schools that include more expensive PRT guidelines.</p>

We will provide a short theoretical overview on the principles of translation alignment, together with a hands-on tutorial on Ugarit (http://ugarit.ialigner.com/), a web-based translation alignment editor. Ugarit is designed as a Citizen Science tool, aiming at collecting training datasets of manually aligned words from diverse text corpora. The ultimate goal of Ugarit is to improve automatic translation alignment methods and to implement a set of dynamic lexica, with particular regard for languages with less supported infrastructures. However, the tool also has a strong pedagogical potential, which has been assessed in the course of various hands-on workshops and in an ongoing integration in school curricula: we have tested how translation alignment with Ugarit can help readers to engage with languages that they have never seen, grasping their essential semantic and morphological aspects. We propose text alignment as a way to empower the perception of the complexity of a language, but also as a method to leverage usual obstacles in the process of reading apparently “impenetrable” sources by directly engaging with them. At present, Ugarit includes aligned pairs from 36 languages (including less represented languages, like Bulgarian, Ethiopic, Sanskrit, Yiddish, and Armenian), 277 unique users, and about 23,400 parallel texts hosted.</p>
