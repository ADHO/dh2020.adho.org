</h2>
<p>A lack of formal training opportunities for data curation in multi-site DH teams means that the data produced in these teams is in danger of being lost! This four-hour workshop will cover all areas of data management including: IP permissions and informed consent, data collection, metadata standards, file sharing, preservation (data deposit), and data sharing through the open data spectrum of access. Participants will work on their own data curation challenges in break-out sessions and with reference to case study examples?presented by a panel of DH scholars and digital asset management specialists: Constance Crompton (uOttawa), Karis Shearer (UBCO), Matthew Lincoln (Carnegie-Mellon U), Mikhel Proulx (Concordia U and Indigenous Digital Art Archive), Meghan Goodchild (Queen’s U and Scholars Portal). The lesson plan is designed and delivered by Felicity Tayler (uOttawa), Sarah Simpkin (uOttawa), and Marjorie Mitchell (UBCO).</p>
<p>This workshop is a good preparation for researchers who must create a data management plan to comply with funding agency requirements. The workshop arises at a moment when DH researchers have greater access to funding to support large-scale multi-partner projects with diverse digital assets. The manifold nature of DH, and its reflexive challenges to culturally imposed power imbalances in digital systems presents unique challenges for data curation. Responding to the conference thematic of cultural and disciplinary intersections, this workshop proposes that DH is one of the social and conceptual spaces where the informal networks of international “data communities” arise through acts of data curation and sharing (Cooper and Springer). Our approach to data curation recognizes that data communities are multilingual and multi-cultural just as they cross epistemological and disciplinary lines.</p>

<p><strong>Description of target audience</strong></p>
<p>This workshop is of interest to DH researchers working in national and international collaborative teams, in particular, those who are funded through agencies that have Data Management Plan requirements. Students and Research Assistants will also benefit from this training, as the next generation of researchers who will adopt these data curation best practices. As a key focus of the conference is First Nations, Native American, and Indigenous Studies (FNAIS), we anticipate that many workshop attendees will bring knowledge systems into the room with them that challenge data curation best practices based in Western traditions of property ownership and colonial methods of data collection - we will address these gaps.</p>
<p><strong>Technical requirements </strong></p>
<p>Should this workshop be accepted, the University of Ottawa Library has committed to hosting us in its “Tinkering Lab,” designed for collaborative learning styles and data visualization. The room is equipped with an 8K LED video wall, and 2 LED 4k displays, as well as capacity for up to 50 participants seated in modular group learning dynamics. We will provide our own technical support. Refreshments will be served in the mezzanine area outside of the Lab.</p>
<p><strong>Syllabus for proposed workshop</strong></p>
<p>Making Research Data Public: <br>Workshopping Data Curation for Digital Humanities Projects <br>Prepared by: Felicity Tayler, Sarah Simpkin, Marjorie Mitchell</p>
<p><strong>Learning Outcome: </strong></p>
<p>By the end of this session, participants will be able to understand data curation terms and best practices, in a way that is meaningful to their own disciplinary and computational methodologies.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong></p>
<p>Participants will be able to <br>1) Recognize and describe their research data <br>2) Identify data curation practices they already undertake <br>3) Describe data management best practices that they could adopt to better achieve their goals <br>4) Summarize what they have learned as it applies to their own projects</p>
