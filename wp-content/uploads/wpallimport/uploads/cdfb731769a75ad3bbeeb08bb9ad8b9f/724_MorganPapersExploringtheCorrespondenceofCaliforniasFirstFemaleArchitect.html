But as the morganpapers.org web application demonstrates, such textual data (both structured and unstructured) can be leveraged to build a variety of tools which provide deeper and broader insight than simple searching and browsing.</p><p dir="ltr">Cal Poly recently completed digitization of a unique body of correspondence between architect Julia Morgan and William Randolph Hearst, carried out during the construction of what is now known as Hearst Castle. The structure is a masterpiece and the crown jewel of Morgan�s illustrious career throughout California, where she worked as the state�s first female licensed architect. The collection consists of over 2,500 letters, telegrams, notes, and other documents, spanning the years 1919-1941. As each piece of correspondence was digitized, it was ingested in the library's archival repository along with its MODS-based metadata, and full-text transcripts.</p></div><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><address>Zach Vowell (zvowell@calpoly.edu), California Polytechnic State University, United States of America, Ethan Kusters , California Polytechnic State University, United States of America, Luca Soares , California Polytechnic State University, United States of America, Samuel Verkruyse , California Polytechnic State University, United States of America, Joey Wilson , California Polytechnic State University, United States of America and Foaad Khosmood , California Polytechnic State University, United States of America</address></div></body></html>
