Open-access (OA) advocates have noted in particular that lukewarm or negative portrayals of OA venues in PRT guidelines can result in decreased participation in OA publishing. In response to this concern, some universities have begun to experiment with adding language to PRT guidelines that invites broader participation in publishing venues, including OA publishing. Of interest in this study is the impact of PRT guidelines on the distribution of open data. Specifically, this poster will rely on information gathered from SHARE to consider the prevalence of participation in open data publishing at schools that include more expensive PRT guidelines.</p></div><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><address>Talea Anderson (talea.anderson@wsu.edu), Washington State University, United States of America</address><div class="pt-4 text-center">
