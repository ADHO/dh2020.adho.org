<p>Re-representing rural memory in cyberspace complying with the principle of publicity is an issue of realistic significance at the moment in China. This paper represents the research findings of a pilot project on “Digital protection and inheritance of historical and cultural villages and towns”, taking Gaoqian village as a case. The main work carried out includes digital arrangement and re-representation of culture heritage of Gaoqian based on cultural analysis, which is the core of the project, and also where publicity basically relies on. The publicity of the approach manifests as followings: 1) It aims at constructing the rural cultural memory of the public; 2) The final products, including a digital repository of Gaoqian cultural materials and a website on Gaoqian rural cultural memory, are for the public; 3) The interested parties i.e. scholars, villagers, local government, and technology companies, work in close corporation.</p>
