<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Digital paleography has been emerging as a field of research since the beginning<br>of the new century. Paleographers, describe how a text has been displayed, and<br>collect information such as writing styles, contextual information and the epoch.<br>Ciula (2017) gives a good summary about digital paleography and its practices.<br>Challenges concerning digital paleography are discussed by Hassner et al. (2015)<br>for writing systems and discussed more broadly in Stokes (2015). The main<br>results of these publications is, that the community of digital paleographers,<br>which was mainly focused on a few particular languages, sees to broaden its<br>scope and to research more global models to represent paleographic features<br>such as writing style, typographic features and anomalies in texts. This calls for<br>a unified representation of paleographic features to which this publication would<br>like to contribute by suggesting a core vocabulary for paleographic description<br>of texts.</p>
<p>Related Work</p>Paleographic features can to a certain extent be represented in TEI/XML1 Wit-<br>tern et al. (2009) (scribal shifts, scribal alterations) as highlighting annotations.<br>For systematic non-alphabetic languages, encodings can be developed to repre-<br>sent the shape of the characters, e.g. for cuneiform and egyptian hieroglyphics<br>Homburg (2019), van den Berg (1997)<p>In the linguistic community, linguistic linked open data (LLOD)McCrae et al.<br>(2016) is very present and allows for tools such as BabelNet Navigli & Ponzetto<br>(2012), a multilingual semantic network to translate words and texts based on<br>semantic content. This publication suggests to create such a semantic network<br>for paleographic descriptions in order to formalize this part of research. Natu-<br>rally, such a task cannot be done by a single scholar from a single field, so the<br>publication begins by suggesting vocabulary contents documenting the structure<br>of systematic scripts like cuneiform and to model relations between components<br>of parts of scripts, the so-called core vocabulary. Especially structured scripts<br>(cf. fig. 1) expose a variety of encoding schemes for e.g. Chinese Bishop & Cook<br>(2003), Japanese Apel (2014). Those encodings have been created to model<br>fonts, but form an ideal basis to create the proposed unified vocabulary. Similar<br>to the OliA ontologies Chiarcos & Sukhareva (2015) the author suggests to ex-<br>tend this core vocabulary representing the structure of the script (figure 3) by<br>language/script specific extensions. The concept will be presented using the ex-<br>ample of cuneiform and egyptian hieroglyphics and builds upon the vocabulary<br>shown in figure 2.</p>

<p>This presentation presents first efforts to develop a vocabulary for paleographic features across different languages. It will feature a case study using cuneiform languages to infer relevant elements for a general vocabulary for paleography. The poster can be seen as a point of discussion and invitation for colleagues of similar and other fields to further develop the vocabulary which can be used to describe writing styles. When finished it is planned to be used among others to benefit machine learning tasks in computational lingustics as a paleographic desctiption of signs can act as a source of features which is rarely exploited in such scenarios.</p>
