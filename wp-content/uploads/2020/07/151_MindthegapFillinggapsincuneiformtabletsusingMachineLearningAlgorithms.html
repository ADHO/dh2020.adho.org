<p>Introduction</p>
<p>A persisting problem in near eastern studies is the existence of broken cuneiform
tablets (listing 1.1). In recent years efforts have been undertaken to 3DScan Mara
et al. (2010), to paleographically describe Homburg (2019) and to digitally recon-
struct broken fragments Collins et al. (2014, 2017) of cuneiform tablets. However,
not always broken fragments can complement each other and often parts of the
cuneiform tablet remain destroyed. These fractures or gaps in the cuneiform
tablet are not always easy for scholars to fill and take a considerable amount of
interpretation time on their part. With the emergence of more digitally available
cuneiform text resources, this publication sees an opportunity to investigate if
auto-complete algorithms, based on machine learning and linguistic linked open
data (LLOD) resources Homburg (2017) can be useful in the reconstruction
of cuneiform texts. The classification results are to be used to create a epoch
and language specific recommendation system to fill gaps on cuneiform tablets,
therefore assisting cuneiform scholars.</p>
<p>Related Work</p>
	<p>Related work has been done in autocompletion systems which face the similar
challenge of anticipating the users input derived from context and other features
Leung & Zhang (2008), Gikandi (2006), Hyv√∂nen & M√§kel√§ (2006). Those tech-
nologies are heavily relied on in input method engines1 which are powered with
different dictionary-based algorithms, but recently Chen et al. (2015), Huang
et al. (2018) also with machine learning approaches and neural networks. Input
method engines for cuneiform have been developed by Homburg et al. (2015).</p>
<p>Methodology</p>
<p>Following Homburg & Chiarcos (2016) machine learning methods applied are
either based on grammatical rules (POSTagging), dictionary-based methods ex-
ploiting (third-party) dictionary resources or statistical approaches using the
following types of machine learning features:
‚Äì Context-dependent features: e.g. for Hidden Markov Model Classifications
‚Äì Grammatical features derived from POSTaggers
‚Äì Semantic Features derived from the semantic meaning of surrounding words
‚Äì Metadata Features e.g. text categorizations
‚Äì Paleographic Features using PaleoCodage for a subset of manually annotated
texts Homburg (2019)</p>
<p>Experimental Setup</p>
The effectiveness of the algorithms and features is tested on a corpus of all CDLI
texts in ATF which is split in a training and test set. Texts are prepared with
random gaps for classification and evaluated using the original texts (the gold
standard) on unicode cuneiform and on the respective cuneiform transliteration
for different cuneiform languages (Sumerian, Hittite, Akkadian) and epochs. The
poster features selected peliminary results of the classification and a significance
analysis of the features for further discussion for improvement. A possible future
goal could be a shared task to improve classification accuracy similar to the
cuneiform language identification challenge Jauhiainen et al. (2019)
<p>Application</p>
<p>Lastly, the poster presents a prototypical application (fig. 1)
displaying the results of the machine learning process which is currently in devel-
opment. The implementation builds up on the concept of input method engines
Homburg et al. (2015) and will provide a self-learning component.</p>

is a gods name (NE) and is commonly preceded by a determinative character for god
íÄ≠(an), which is suggested in first place to fill the gap. Next likely options are a
person named Enlil (male or female), the people (tribe) of Enlil, or a location</p>
