Much of the criticisms towards the justice system have focused on the testimony, which revictimizes the victim by forcing them to relive the events while having their credibility put in doubt. This suggests that sexual assault victims are treated very differently to victims of other crimes (Brody 2011). In this paper, we wish to substantiate, measure and qualify this claim in the context of Canadian criminal law through this question: is testimony being treated differently in sexual assault cases vs. in cases of assault which doesn't involve sexual activity? To address this question, we use topic models to identify discussions about testimony in court decisions from the Quebec Court of Appeal, and measure how they differ in sexual assault cases along various variables.</p></div><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><address>Louis Chartrand (lochartrand@gmail.com), University of Pittsburgh, Canada and Ulisce Desmarais-Gr�goire , Desmarais Desvignes Crespo</address></div></body></html>
