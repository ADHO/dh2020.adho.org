The course materials we need to make are only scripts for talks and XML data for slides, and the process we need to undertake separately is just recording the talk. The mechanisms to realize this course are backed with HTML5 and simple codes in JavaScript based on the specification HTML Imports. This lecture system is important not only for an implementation to realize a new teaching/learning channel conveying the knowledge instantly to learners but also to show the evidence for usefullness of HTML Imports as a sign of the existence of users' requirements.</p></div><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><address>Kazushi Ohya (oya-k@tsurumi-u.ac.jp), Tsurumi University, Japan</address></div></body></html>
