Workshop participants learn how to visualize the life cycle of a project using human-centered design and backwards modelling when planning their projects to better understand how to version, archive, and preserve their research projects. This poster shares our experience with designing and running this workshop series at the University of Michigan and will give us an opportunity to connect with peers to build a community of practice for digital humanities scholars who develop and lead workshops. Materials from the workshop series will be shared as open data.</p></div><div class="stdfooter autogenerated"><address>Caitlin Pollock (pollock.caitlin@gmail.com), University of Michigan, United States of America and Joe Bauer (joebauer@umich.edu), University of Michigan, United States of America</address></div></body></html>
